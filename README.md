# Mobile-Devops-How-To

## Overview 

I've been working in the Mobile Applications Development space, mostly in a "larger than 3 people" space for a while.  People have asked what does it take to do mobile app "production" work past where the obligatory "Hello World" app gets done. 

This "body of knowledge" (BOK) work is my attempt at collecting some patterns, pointers, and processes that I've seen or been a part of over the past few years.

The core of the book is this markdown doc --> [Mobile Application Development And Publication.md](https://github.com/mcm30114/Mobile-Devops-How-To/blob/master/Mobile%20Application%20Development%20And%20Publication.md)

Feel free to contribute (after all, I did post this in a public repo).  My only ask is that you can reference this work, with proper credits. 

I'm open to all content and suggestions, so feel free to throw out pull requests and let's discuss.

TIA

Michael "Giant Mike" Martin
